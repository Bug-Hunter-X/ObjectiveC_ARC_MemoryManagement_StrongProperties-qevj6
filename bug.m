In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

This code seems harmless. However, if `someMethod` is called multiple times, each call creates a new `NSString`, leading to memory leaks.  The `strong` property ensures that `MyClass` retains the string, preventing it from being deallocated.  The subsequent calls overwrite `myString`, creating orphaned `NSString` objects.

Another potential issue is related to the `copy` attribute. Using `copy` instead of `strong` for an NSString property means each time you assign a value, it creates a new immutable copy of the string, leading to increased memory usage if not carefully managed.
